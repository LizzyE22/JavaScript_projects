JavaScript Projects

The following are some projects I made using JavaScript.

Projects:


**Pizza Menu**

This project is a menu used to order pizza, offering several different toppings. It takes the information the user has inputted and calculates the total price for the order.


**Calculator**

This project is a basic 4-function calculator, where the use can add, subtract, multiply and divide.


**Tic Tac Toe Game**

Here you have a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Users can play against the computer and the color and sounds add a fun spin to the game!
